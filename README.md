# CPSC 211
## This is an online, self-paced, non-credit  course on data structures and advanced programming in C++ for the MSS students of UBC .

### Assignment 1: Date Class
#### The purpose of this assignment is to design the class "Date" and define operations to handle calendar-based calculations. We will frequently use this class in the later assignments. The Date class should contain 3 integers for storing values of day (d), month (m), and year (y). Another important integer, daysPassed (p), indicates how many days exist between a given date and a reference date, say 1/Jan./1800. This reference year should be stored in the class as, e.g.,
static const int baseYear 1800;
